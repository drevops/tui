# TUI playground

Runnable examples of the `drevops/tui` engine, one file per example, grouped by a numbered `NN-topic-` prefix in learning order. Every script is self-contained: it requires the Composer autoloader directly, declares its whole form inline and handles its own output, so any single file can be copied out as a starting point. Most take no CLI options - each demonstrates exactly one thing, and variants are separate scripts - with one exception: [`03-panels-fullscreen.php`](03-panels-fullscreen.php) picks its alignment with `--halign`/`--valign` (plus `--max-width`) rather than spreading nine near-identical files.

Reusable helper classes the scripts load sit in [`themes/`](themes) and [`handlers/`](handlers); the fixtures the examples read from are in [`sample-project/`](sample-project) - one example project the file-picker and discovery demos share - and [`translations/`](translations).

```bash
composer install
php playground/01-quickstart.php
```

Every interactive script also runs unattended: pipe stdin (or run it from CI) and the answers resolve from defaults and `TUI_<ID>` environment variables instead of prompting.

## Running the examples

Each script prints how to invoke it in its `@file` docblock. The common patterns:

```bash
# Interactive TUI (any interactive example).
php playground/14-produce-box.php

# Unattended: defaults and environment answer instead of a keyboard.
TUI_NAME='Summer Box' php playground/14-produce-box.php < /dev/null

# Discovery uses its own env prefix, declared by the form.
BOX_SEASON=winter php playground/08-discovery.php
```

Display modes follow the terminal and the standard environment conventions, so no script needs flags for them:

```bash
NO_COLOR=1 php playground/02-widgets-select.php       # colour off
LC_ALL=C php playground/02-widgets-select.php         # ASCII glyphs
COLORFGBG='0;15' php playground/02-widgets-select.php # hint a light background
```

## How the TUI picks a theme

Set it on the `Tui` facade with `->theme(...)`, lowest friction first:

1. **Name the class** - `->theme('\Your\ThemeClass')`. The class is instantiated directly; no registration needed. This is what [`09-themes-custom.php`](09-themes-custom.php) does.
2. **Register a short name** - `ThemeManager::register('accent', AccentTheme::class)`, then `->theme('accent')`. Useful to give a class a stable alias. This is what [`09-themes-options.php`](09-themes-options.php) does.
3. **Built-in name** - `->theme('midnight')` (or `frost`, `ember`, `mono`, `default` or `dos`). Dark or light is a separate `mode` display option, not a theme, so a built-in adapts to both. One script per theme, `09-themes-<name>.php`.
4. **Auto-detect** - leave it unset (or `->theme('auto')`) and the `default` theme is used, with the interactive TUI picking the dark or light `mode` from the terminal background (an OSC 11 query, then `COLORFGBG`, then a dark default). Setting `mode` explicitly opts out. This is what [`11-display-modes-mode-auto.php`](11-display-modes-mode-auto.php) demonstrates.

## How the TUI sets key bindings

Set them on the `Tui` facade with `->keys(...)`, mirroring `->theme(...)`:

1. **A preset name** - `->keys('vim')` for the built-in vim navigation, or a name registered with `KeyMapManager::register('name', MyKeyMap::class)`.
2. **A preset class** - `->keys('\Your\KeyMapClass')`, instantiated directly with no registration.
3. **Overrides** - `->keys('default', [new Binding(Scope::field(FieldType::Select), Action::Accept, KeyName::Tab)])` retunes individual bindings on top of a preset. A binding names a scope (the base, navigation, or a widget type), an action and its keys.
4. **Defaults** - leave it unset for the built-in bindings. This is what most examples do.

Conflicting or un-typeable bindings throw when the facade is configured, so a bad key map is caught at declaration time, not mid-session. Both override styles live in [`10-key-bindings-vim.php`](10-key-bindings-vim.php) and [`10-key-bindings-custom.php`](10-key-bindings-custom.php).
