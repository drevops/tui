 * An inline field expands its editor in place on the panel when activated - the
 * widget's own view, driven by its own keys, collapsing back to a one-line
 * summary on accept or cancel - so a value changes without leaving the panel.
 * A standalone field opens that same editor full-screen instead, the better fit
 * for a widget that wants the whole viewport. Fields are inline by default; a
 * consumer opts one out with the builder's standalone() method.
